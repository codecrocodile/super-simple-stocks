In order to simplify the code some assumptions have been made:

Par value of a stock will never be zero

Stock price of a stock will never be zero

Fixed dividend of a preferred stock will never be zero

Rounding of BigDecimal results will be done by the client of the application
	
Calculation off stock priced is based on the last 15 minutes of trading. If nothing has been traded in the 
last 15 minutes then the stock priced is based on the last stock traded. In this case the no stocks have been
traded then the stock priced is then the par value of the stock.

Data store assumes that no trade will be recorded at exactly the same time (not multi-threaded)
